# Olist_customer_segmentation
Olist wishes to obtain a segmentation of its customers that can be used on a daily basis by their marketing team in their communication campaigns. The goal is to understand different types of users through their behavior and anonymized personal data.

So here we will provide an actionable description of segmentation and its underlying logic for optimal use. We will also need to provide an analysis of the stability of the segments over time (with the aim of establishing a maintenance contract).

We will therefore use unsupervised methods to group together customers with similar profiles.

# Dataset 
Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist

Welcome! This is a Brazilian ecommerce public dataset of orders made at Olist Store. The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allows viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers. We also released a geolocation dataset that relates Brazilian zip codes to lat/lng coordinates.

This is real commercial data, it has been anonymised, and references to the companies and partners in the review text have been replaced with the names of Game of Thrones great houses.
